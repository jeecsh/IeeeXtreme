# IEEExtreme Solutions

Welcome to my repository! This contains my solutions to the **IEEExtreme programming competition** problems.

## About Me

This was my first programming competition, and it was an exciting challenge! I scored **520 points** and ranked around **1800th** globally. While not all of my solutions were perfect, I learned a lot throughout the process.

## What You'll Find Here

You'll find the code I wrote during the competition. Some solutions work flawlessly, while others might need a bit more refining. Regardless, this repo serves as a record of my progress and experience.
